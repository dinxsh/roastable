# QuickCast Farcaster Mini App - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Executive Summary

**Product**: QuickCast - AI-Powered Viral Content Generator
**Platform**: Farcaster Mini App on Base Blockchain  
**Build Timeline**: 1 Day Development Sprint
**Target Audience**: Farcaster users seeking viral social content generation

QuickCast is a single-feature Farcaster Mini App that generates personalized "roast cards" or "hype cards" based on users' Farcaster profile data. The app leverages AI content generation, blockchain integration, and social sharing mechanics to create viral moments within the Farcaster ecosystem[1][2].

## Problem Statement
